This program experiments with using a binary tree. The user is able to insert numbers based off of what they select in
the menu of the program and then the program displays the binary tree in post order, pre order, and in order. The user
can continue entering numbers or search for a specific number. One can also check to see how many nodes there are in the binary
tree and you can test to see if the empty method actually works.

Expected Output:

Binary Tree Test
